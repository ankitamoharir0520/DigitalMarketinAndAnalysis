Has nice sound when playing music as well.', 'Music', 'I received the echo as a gift. I needed another Bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible, and found this smart speaker. Can’t wait to see what else it can do.', 'Without having a cellphone, I cannot use many of her features. I have an iPad but do not see that of any use.  It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet.', \"I think this is the 5th one I've purchased. I'm working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.\", 'looks great', 'Love it!

Learning knew things with it eveyday! Still figuring out how everything works but so far it's been easy to use and understand. She does make me laugh at times\", 'I purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now, to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she did.She enjoys all the little and big things it can do...Alexa play this song, What time is it and where, and how to cook this and that!', 'Love, Love, Love!!', 'Just what I expected....', 'I love it, wife hates it.', 'Really happy with this purchase.  Great speaker and easy to set up.', 'We have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.', 'We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound', \"I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it's just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what's not to like? :)\", 'Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.', \"We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume. We're sure we'll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it's a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn't understand what we're saying.\", 'Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it’s not intrusive to look at.', 'I love it.

I use it mainly to play my favorite tunes and test Alexa's knowledge.\", 'Sounds great!! Love them!', 'Fun item to play with and get used to using.  Sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask, but I think it will be better.', 'Just like the other one', 'Still learning all the capabilities...but so far pretty pretty pretty good', 'I like it', 'She works well. Needs a learning command  for unique, owners and users like. Alexa “learn” Tasha’s birthday.  Or Alexa “learn” my definition of Fine. Etc. other than that she is great', \"The speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I've done it correctly but they won't sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.\", 'This device is awesome!', 'I bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.', 'Love my Echo. Still learning all the things it will do. Wasn’t able to follow instructions included in the package, but found a great one on U-Tube.', 'Speaker is better than 1st generation Echo', 'This thing is way cool!  You should get one.  If you want to be cool, that is.', \"This is my first digital assistant so I'm giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That's what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven't had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. My purchase came with a Smart Plug for $10 which I connect my lamp to. Alexa, turn of the lights!\", \"My husband likes being able to use it to listen to music.  I wish we knew all it's capabilities\", 'My Android would not allow Alexa to connect. Fortunately, my sister was here with her Apple cell. After an hour+ tech support fixed the glitches.

Alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to Jimmy Buffet by just asking Alexa.', \"It's like Siri, in fact, Siri answers more accurately then Alexa.  I don't see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals.\", 'Love my Echo. Still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun.', 'I love you so much', 'No different than Apple. To play a specific list of music you must have an Amazon of Spotify “plus/prime/etc” account.  So you must pay to play “your” music.  3 stars for that reason.

It works well. I’m hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many “apps” you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I’m looking forward to implementing this controll. You can also add other Alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located.', 'The speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly!', 'I LIKE IT ALL', 'I love it.

Best gift ever!', 'Works fine!!', 'Good', 'Clear music', 'Fun to use, good sound quality', 'The echo works well. I was able to sync it with my other Amazon music devices.', \"Works great, but I don't think Amazon should charge another cent for unlimited music when you 1) Have Prime AND 2) Buy an Echo.\", 'Already had an Echo Dot. The Echo is even better with fuller sound. Also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great!', 'The speaker sounds really good', 'Good sound works well', 'Love it and Alexa. I am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient.', \"Love it! I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It's fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I've been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music.\", 'We like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet.', \"Love it - am using it strictly for music now and it's great!\", 'Love the Echo !!! I love the size, material and speaker quality. I have it hooked up to one light easily and will work on additional lights and thermostat. Next is Echo Dot for bedroom.

Happy with the purchase.', 'Very easy to set up. Works wonderful and I love it!!', \"I'm really impressed with the sound quality when playing music from this device.  The bass sounds almost like it's coming from a bigger speaker so props to Amazon.\", 'It’s still a great product.But the sound quality does seem worse.Don’t get me wrong. You definitely get used to it within an hour. But it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was better.Besides that , it’s great.With the addition of being able to play Just over Bluetooth with no WiFi, it’s even better.', 'The outlet does not work with it. Was disappointed in that.', 'Great device, responsive and helpful', 'Sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose', \"i liked the sound . what is troubling is that I paid extra money to have access to a million more songs. Sometimes it doesn't work. Ex. Alexa play Italian songs&#34; .don't have or don&#34; t understand. or play the opera Tosca, response &#34;sorry I don&#34;t have that.\", 'Easy to set up and use. Too bad it has to be plugged in. Would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged.', 'Still learning all the ways to use it.  It is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it.  (5 and 7 yrs).  Very cute.', \"4.5 out of 5 Stars. I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. Reason why I didn't rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my Echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. Seems to be a connection issue.

Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.

Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. If you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. Once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo.

I called Amazon customer service, and I dunno what it is, but lately I’ve been getting terrible support. The guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and I ended up setting up the Dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.I’m not sure if this is the norm or if it’s because this is refurbished, but the Dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5GHz connection is strong. Reconnecting is a pain each time as well.All that said, when Alexa works, she works amazingly well. I don’t have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing I really enjoy is the mic’s range and sensitivity. One of the more annoying limitations of Apple’s Siri is that when she’s playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the “Hey Siri” feature is all but useless. Alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. I haven’t tried this with louder speakers yet, so I’m not sure if this will continue to hold true.Setting up Alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations — support for Arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your LED devices (eg. rainbow effects), Alexa can’t handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.All in all, my rating would’ve been lower had I not gotten a decent price on this item. If the connectivity problems persist, I may have to exchange/return this item. I don’t want to though — Alexa’s kind of growing on me.', 'I bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs. But I have no need for it. I only used it once.

Bought it from the &#34;warehouse&#34; or &#34;outlet&#34; with a &#34;minor imperfection. Can't tell it even has one. works great. Didn't come in packaging, but it was sealed up and had no damage and wasn't missing anything. I like the sound quality, I see some knock it. It's not a BOSE but it's more than great for our family. Easy to use, minor learning curve as it learns your voice. It integrates seamlessly with my other amazon services.Can't wait to get for my classroom too! It's a lot of fun even just as a speaker, let alone what I plan to do with it.\", \"I love my Echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it's wonderful!, music, info, sleeping sounds!\", \"Awesome life changer! Seriously, I am able to start my morning with Alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music. She has gotten used to my voice, that I can be in another room and she will &#34;listen&#34; to what I say. I love both my echos!!! Don't hesitate, get one and for the price, the speaker is unbelievable. I am buying the cordless holder, so I can take the echo anywhere. Love my purchase and love alexa!!!!\", \"I am not super impressed with Alexa. When my Prime lapsed, she wouldn't play anything. She isn't smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can't use it for that either. She randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her. Just today I unplugged her...not sure I'll ever use my Alexa again.\", 'I like everything about it !!!', 'Liked 100%', 'Never had ANY issue with buying use electronics as long as I get the GOOD or LIKE NEW.

Unfortunately, it doesn't understand or respond to my requests as well as the Dot. I frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what I want. The Dot usually does exactly what I want on the first request. I don't consider it an upgrade.\", 'I have had all good experience, so far with the second generation Echo. There are so many more things to learn, but I have not had the time yet. Right now, I am mostly enjoying the music, weather updates, using the alarm feature, and her personality. I have also purchased some mini smart socket yes. I am very excited to begin using them', 'I’m having trouble connecting my tv to it, but I’m not exactly tech smart. I’m sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me. So far I’ve been using it mostly for music.', \"Simply love my Echo. I hardly watch any TV at all anymore. I'm too busy listening to music. Speaker is pretty goo for its size. All the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family.\", 'Enjoyed entire echo experience', 'Easy to set up.', \"The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me.\", 'We are loving Ours very much', \"I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best. I'm happy to see they are making improvements with each new one.It would be great to have updates to our little A.I.'s, I think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it.

It is so nice to have Alexa available for music, weather, news, and probably a lot more we haven’t discovered.', 'I am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the Echo. If you are a big fan of deep bass, this might not be sufficient for you though. The potential to control your home is an option I will explore more as I evolve my home into a \"smart home\". The voice recognition is very impressive. It is stylish and fun. I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. If you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. Once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo. I am not embarrassed to say, that echo has made me laugh a couple times when I ask it to tell me a joke.

      "Without having a cellphone, I cannot use many of her features. I have an iPad but do not see that of any use.  It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet.\n",

      "We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound\n",
      "I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it's just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what's not to like? :)\n",
      "Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.\n",
      "We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume. We're sure we'll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it's a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn't understand what we're saying.\n",

      "The speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I've done it correctly but they won't sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.\n",
      "This device is awesome!\n",
      "I bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.\n",

      "This thing is way cool!  You should get one.  If you want to be cool, that is.\n",
      "This is my first digital assistant so I'm giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That's what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven't had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. My purchase came with a Smart Plug for $10 which I connect my lamp to. Alexa, turn of the lights!\n",

      "I bought this because it can control fios television. It works well. I’m hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many “apps” you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I’m looking forward to implementing this controll. You can also add other Alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located.\n",

      "Love it and Alexa. I am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient.\n",
      "Love it! I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It's fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I've been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music.\n",
      "We like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet.\n",
      "Love it - am using it strictly for music now and it's great!\n",

      "It’s still a great product.But the sound quality does seem worse.Don’t get me wrong. You definitely get used to it within an hour. But it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was better.Besides that , it’s great.With the addition of being able to play Just over Bluetooth with no WiFi, it’s even better.\n",

      "Sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose\n",
      "i liked the sound . what is troubling is that I paid extra money to have access to a million more songs. Sometimes it doesn't work. Ex. Alexa play Italian songs&#34; .don't have or don&#34; t understand. or play the opera Tosca, response &#34;sorry I don&#34;t have that.\n",
      "Easy to set up and use. Too bad it has to be plugged in. Would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged.\n",
      "Still learning all the ways to use it.  It is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it.  (5 and 7 yrs).  Very cute.\n",
      "4.5 out of 5 Stars. I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. Reason why I didn't rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my Echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. Seems to be a connection issue. Overall, great product.\n",

      "I've had the first gen Echo since it first came out and it has worked well for me. I purchased the 2nd gen during Prime Day and so far I'm happy. It seems to have an improved speaker which provides enhanced sound for music and such.\n",
      "I love my Echo smart speaker.  I love the volume and clarity.  It was easy to set up.  ITs a wonderful gift for any age.\n",
      "wonderful product and fast delivery!\n",
      "Initially harder to set up called tech wasn’t that knowledgeable now working great.\n",
      "It was very easy to set up and my family love it’s!\n",
      "Has great sound and is very responsive my voice and commands.\n",
      "How did I live this long without the Echo . You get to enjoy any music style  just my asking Alexa . Going to up-greade to the wireless . Love the Echo . Love you too Alexa .\n",
      "Very cool product. Speaker sounds good with my Spotify blasting through it.\n",
      "Having so much fun with Alexa. Love being able to listen to music when I’m across the room or busy doing something else.\n",
      "So far it seems to be a very nice item. It picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. The other day I asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine. I've only used it to listen to music and check the weather, but it has done both of those things very well.\n",
      "Love our echo\n",
      "I love it,she is very helpful. I use her for remembering things and sleep. You can ask her just about anything. I have only had her for about a week so still learning her.\n",
      "It's better than the 1st gen in every way except for one.  I really miss the ring at the top for volume control.  It was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &#34;-&#34; one and press it a few times.  I also wish the bass was a bit better.  All in all, it's a great device and I'm happy with it.\n",
      "I love having an Alexa!\n",
      "So far I like it 🤓\n",
      "I am thoroughly enjoying my Ecoo!  Love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then I can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere. Wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book. Great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more.\n",
      "Still love it\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "I love the sound quality of this unit, it is a very clear sound.\n",
      "I just this for listening to talk radio in the morning and turning lights on and off etc. The system does an excellent job as a full house sound system streaming Sirius.\n",
      "I have had for only a week, so I am still learning all that Alexa can do.  It is a learning process.  I love the music I can call up any time.  I listen to podcasts and radio stations.  I have just started keeping shopping lists and grocery lists, which I love.  I don’t have to search for paper and pencil.  Getting time and temperature are great, do not have to wait for weather reports.  The sound is good.  I am not fussy about woofers, tweeters, base , etc.  the Echo is fine for me.  This afternoon I am going to try “dropping in”.on my son when he gets home.  Going to surprise him.\n",
      "Not much features.\n",
      "Great sound quality, great features, great product. Multi room music is very cool.\n",
      "Cool\n",
      "Everyone should have an Echo or two or three or more. I bought my Echo through QVC.\n",
      "it's annoying that everything they show Alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. You spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself\n",
      "I have had Alexa since the beginning.  I accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation.  I decided I couldn't be without an Echo.  Setup was easy and had it working within minutes.\n",
      "I like being able to tell Alexia the music I want to hear, but sometimes she has trouble finding the song if I am not very specific about the title.\n",
      "I like the looks better than the original echo.  I moved my old echo to the basement family room. Nice sound.\n",
      "The Echo is wonderful but I'm still learning how to use it. Music requests are somewhat limited.\n",
      "Doesn't know half the things asked. Can't recognize my sprinkler wifi controller, even though product details says it is compatible. Can't program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same wifi router. Just a handy music player. That's if you have Amazon Music.\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "awesome.understands my kids\n",
      "We were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and the many features. How nice to easily hear a particular artist or hear our books just by a simple command. Looking forward to exploring other options with this device.\n",
      "Met and exceeded my expectations. Easy set up and is really quick in responses.\n",
      "I like the fact that I can get any kind of music from Prime that I want on request from Alexa. I liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your TV etc. to the commands from Alexa. BUT, I really love having the music.\n",
      "i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  I think it should be part of the top line with video, music, etc.  I also think the setup app where i define, for example music i like, is not well integrated into echo.  I have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings.  I also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names, which i can never remember.I like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries.\n",
      "This is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better. Thank you!\n",
      "During Prime Day this 2nd gen Echo was on sale so I couldn't resist! This was the beginning to my smart home set up and I couldn't be happier to say that Alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my \"smart\" devices. Thanks to her, I can control my lights, smart plugs, TV, etc. I had no trouble connecting the Echo to my WiFi and my phone. The app works perfectly fine and it let's you add skills, routines, smart devices, timers, and so much more! Sound quality is good enough for me, since I am not an audiophile. Alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume. Design is great and modern, it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you'd like as there are more for sale. Overall, this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities. If you haven't yet, be sure to add Alexa to your home!\n",
      "Versatile and fun !!!\n",
      "Works great! Killer speaker! My wife and son love it.\n",
      "We regret waiting so long to purchase this item. We are both surprised and pleased with the sound quality.\n",
      "Stopped working after 2 weeks ,didn't follow commands!? Really fun when it was working?\n",
      "so far love it working on getting more things set up love the grocery list app\n",
      "It performs pretty much as expected, but I am very disappointed it will not provide me with the terminology I need to play various kinds of music without subscribing to the Amazon music service.  I understand my music choices may be limited, but without knowing HOW TO ASK, I cannot access the music that is provided free along with my Echo purchase.  Do you have a chart showing the language I need to use?\n",
      "Easy to set up.\n",
      "I like the product except that the speakers are not the high quality I expected\n",
      "A great investment. Alexa has helped me out and made me laugh.\n",
      "Yet another Exho for our home and love them all!!!\n",
      "I love it, I can plan any gender of music from big band to jazz, not easy to find on local radio. Sound is good and I can stop it with a voice command if I get a phone call.\n",
      "Good Value\n",
      "Super easy set up and am loving our new Echo!\n",
      "Whats not to like about this speaker.  Just ask Alexa\n",
      "BEST father's day gift. Dad joked to my mom that Alexa will be the one listening to all of his (repeated) stories going forward.\n",
      "Great addition to our breakfast room kitchen.  Tunes and information instantly available.  Slowly learning more features.\n",
      "Sound quality\n",
      "Sad joke. Worthless.\n",
      "Entertainment\n",
      "Very good quality\n",
      "Works great sounds great does not miss a beat wish it had a battery for better portability\n",
      "Loved it till someone stoled it. Can't afford to replace it yet but I am going too.\n",
      "Alexa rocks\n",
      "Got this as a gift and love it. I never would have bought one for myself, but now that I have it.... Allows me to play music on it from my amozon prime music ; that's worth it in and of itself.  Also, gives new's briefs and tells jokes.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "My mom bought a few Echo Dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great. I told her “no” for two days. When she made me take it, 6 hours later I could not live my life without it!  It’s that amazing, so now we have four large speakers and only the small Echo Dot, that I will be returning to her. I say if you’re going to order an Alexa speaker, go big and get the Echo, otherwise tou’ll Be returning the two Echo Dots you couldn’t live without.\n",
      "Love it!! Great product!!!\n",
      "Easy set up very user friendly\n",
      "Really disappointed Alexa has to be plug-in to wall socket all the time.  My fault for not checking this, but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as Amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery.  If I could return it, I would as my Apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the Alexa.\n",
      "I don't think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn't unique to this unit but I don't understand why I can't override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.\n",
      "Everything\n",
      "I like the interaction of asking questions. I don’t like that I can’t ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp.\n",
      "Supberb sound! Definitely worth the extra money if you listen to lots of music.\n",
      "I really love my amazon echo. I think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it. It is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports!\n",
      "Love it!  So do the grandkids!!\n",
      "So far it has worked well. Not always intuitive as to how to link different devices, or \"skills\", but getting the hang of it.\n",
      "Works as advertised\n",
      "I love it!\n",
      "Love my new addition to the house! Speaker quality is great and over all we love our Alexa. My only two ( not complaints, more suggestions for the future series) would be better communication ability. Example: For our smart lights in the house. Unless we specify kitchen Light 1 or kitchen Light 2 prior to the command she either won’t respond or says she doesn’t recognize. It may be me, but I want my Alexa to respond when I say thank you afterwards. I have to repeat Alexa thank you and there are times she won’t respond to me, but will my husband. I know it sounds odd. We laugh about it, but maybe it’s a Southern thing but I want my Alexa to have manners too.\n",
      "Like everything about it. The music, the trivia games, the weather.\n",
      "As described and received on time.  Do not like automatic enrolment into music.\n",
      "A great device\n",
      "I owned an echo for overa year but the new lacks the easy way to increase or decrease volume without telling it to increase or decrease volume which is hard to do for my wife since English is her second language she was born in korea. But the sound from the echo is superb. So we’ll keep it..\n",
      "Love this!  Have it in the kitchen and works well!\n",
      "Very nice!  I'm impressed - wish she had more to say though.\n",
      "Love the product. Nice to have easy access to so much info!!!\n",
      "It's got great sound and bass but it doesn't work all of the time. Its still hot or miss when it recognizes things\n",
      "We are still discovering all that the Echo can do.\n",
      "Amazing paroduct\n",
      "Good hearing range and sound quality. It was a bit complicated to set up and she doesn't quite understand me a lot even when I am speaking slowly and clearly but I love the flash briefing feature and interfacing with my abode home security system.\n",
      "speaker sounds good\n",
      "Absolutely love!!\n",
      "The best part of this product is you can control the thermostat and lights for your house.  There isn’t anything I dislike.\n",
      "We're thoroughly enjoying our Amazon Echo. Installation was easy using the Alexa app. I purchased 2 Kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights. Installation again was easy using the Kasa app. They sinqued right up with the Echo. We're enjoying playing music with the Echo and the sound quality is awesome. We've added a Kasa smart bulb for our kitchen. Setup was seamless. We're looking forward to adding more automation to our home.\n",
      "Home entertainment\n",
      "Very cool product. Easy to setup, fun to use and sound quality is much better than I anticipated.\n",
      "Love these,  great sound... easy to connect and use...\n",
      "Doesn't work with my fairly new smart TV, but that's mainly the TV manufacturers(LG) fault due to not supporting anything older than TVs from this year. My smart locks also need an additional piece of equipment in order to connect as well. Speakers sound great and works very well.\n",
      "Great sound from a little speaker\n",
      "We enjoy it\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Cool\n",
      "Good quality, great sound quality\n",
      "Works perfectly\n",
      "Great product. Sometimes Alexa does not understand some commands for my Fire TV. All in all, this is a fabulous speaker.\n",
      "Love my Echo great sound very smart!\n",
      "Sure did !! Love it !!\n",
      "plays great\n",
      "Works absolutely great\n",
      "Very amazing product. Great sound quality.\n",
      "Best thing I've invested in in a while thank you so much 😁😁😁😁\n",
      "I am extremely impressed with this item. Bought it from the &#34;warehouse&#34; or &#34;outlet&#34; with a &#34;minor imperfection. Can't tell it even has one. works great. Didn't come in packaging, but it was sealed up and had no damage and wasn't missing anything. I like the sound quality, I see some knock it. It's not a BOSE but it's more than great for our family. Easy to use, minor learning curve as it learns your voice. It integrates seamlessly with my other amazon services.Can't wait to get for my classroom too! It's a lot of fun even just as a speaker, let alone what I plan to do with it.\n",
      "I love my Echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it's wonderful!, music, info, sleeping sounds!\n",
      "Awesome life changer! Seriously, I am able to start my morning with Alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music. She has gotten used to my voice, that I can be in another room and she will &#34;listen&#34; to what I say. I love both my echos!!! Don't hesitate, get one and for the price, the speaker is unbelievable. I am buying the cordless holder, so I can take the echo anywhere. Love my purchase and love alexa!!!!\n",
      "I am not super impressed with Alexa. When my Prime lapsed, she wouldn't play anything. She isn't smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can't use it for that either. She randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her. Just today I unplugged her...not sure I'll ever use my Alexa again.\n",
      "I like everything about it !!!\n",
      "Liked 100%\n",
      "Never had ANY issue with buying use electronics as long as I get the GOOD or LIKE NEW. Just read the comment to see why it is used.\n",
      "Our family really loves this new Echo\n",
      "bought for my wife she loves it\n",
      "Fun just got it today now my I pod will go in my car and I will use this is the house.\n",
      "Like it to do more\n",
      "This is our third echo. Worth every penny. It's like having 3 household employees for a small flat rate. We keep them in the bedrooms and the living room. We can drop-in and use them as an intercom, listen to music, answer quick questions, alarms to wake up for school, etc.\n",
      "Listen music and set timer\n",
      "I received the echo in perfect condition. The device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues. Alexa is a great addition to our family!\n",
      "Good sound. Like it for music and scheduling. Like that i can get random thoughts recorded while I think about them. The jokes are cute!\n",
      "Purchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do.  So far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform.  Am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides.\n",
      "This echo is just as great as my others, even though it is smaller.\n",
      "Funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home!!!  Loving it!!\n",
      "I bought this to replace a &#34;Dot&#34; in my living room. Speaker is slightly better. It hears me better over the TV. Unfortunately, it doesn't understand or respond to my requests as well as the Dot. I frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what I want. The Dot usually does exactly what I want on the first request. I don't consider it an upgrade.\n",
      "I have had all good experience, so far with the second generation Echo. There are so many more things to learn, but I have not had the time yet. Right now, I am mostly enjoying the music, weather updates, using the alarm feature, and her personality. I have also purchased some mini smart socket yes. I am very excited to begin using them\n",
      "I’m having trouble connecting my tv to it, but I’m not exactly tech smart. I’m sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me. So far I’ve been using it mostly for music.\n",
      "Simply love my Echo. I hardly watch any TV at all anymore. I'm too busy listening to music. Speaker is pretty goo for its size. All the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family.\n",
      "Enjoyed entire echo experience\n",
      "Easy to set up.\n",
      "The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me.\n",
      "We are loving Ours very much\n",
      "I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best. I'm happy to see they are making improvements with each new one.It would be great to have updates to our little A.I.'s, I think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it. All in all I am very happy with her and I can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble. Thank you\n",
      "Very pleased with the Echo 2nd Generation. It is so nice to have Alexa available for music, weather, news, and probably a lot more we haven’t discovered.\n",
      "I am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the Echo. If you are a big fan of deep bass, this might not be sufficient for you though. The potential to control your home is an option I will explore more as I evolve my home into a \"smart home\". The voice recognition is very impressive. It is stylish and fun. I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. If you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. Once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo. I am not embarrassed to say, that echo has made me laugh a couple times when I ask it to tell me a joke. It tells me where my packages are since I am an amazon prime addict, it comes in extremely  handy!\n",
      "Easy to setup. Love all the things she does.\n",
      "Have Alexa throughout the house----the future has arrived!\n",
      "I already have an Alexa and with Amazon find today I could not resist getting an echo also. It is the best thing I ever did, I use them on each side of the house! And couldn't be happier!\n",
      "Arrived as expected.\n",
      "Bought this a few weeks ago -  everything about this product is excellent !!!!! Don't forget to buy a charger when ordering, it's a must have to take outside by the pool and not have to worry about hiring an electrician to put in outlets all over the yard.\n",
      "Terrific\n",
      "Love my Echo\n",
      "It’s smaller than the original. Looks nicer too.\n",
      "Works great!\n",
      "My husband and I are what I would call &#34;late adopters&#34; when it come to technology, but we decide we would try and Echo to serve primarily as a music source.  Wow, were we amazed and the great sound!  We've also been having a great time listening to all of our favorite songs buy just asking Alexa.  I may even buy one for my elderly Dad - I think he will enjoy having one to listen to music or even place his calls to us!\n",
      "I really have enjoyed it.  Changing the Directv channels, plays iHeartRadio and Pandora , adjusts the ac thermostat and turns the living room lights and outside lights.\n",
      "I have been wanting one of these for a while now.  Bought on Prime Day and absolutely love it.\n",
      "We are so glad that we got the Echo over a Bluetooth speaker. Alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there. I personally love the timer feature. It has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously. Pandora integration is another feature that I use daily. So happy with out Prime Day purchase. I will get the Echo hub and a few more Echo dots in the future.\n",
      "See subject line.  Love it\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "Very easy setup.\n",
      "I was hesitant to buy the echo because I have the echo Dot and it seems good enough. The echo is the same except the sound quality, which I really didn't feel I needed. However, I am so glad I got it. What a difference! The sound really is far superior to the Echo Dot! Now I can listen to The Greatest Showman with a little more power!\n",
      "Sound quality is great. Still learning about all the different things I can do with it. FUN!!!\n",
      "Got a good deal and works great with Prime.  Setup was a bit of a pain but more the fault of crappy internet service.  Has worked great with nice sound from small speaker.\n",
      "I love it!!\n",
      "Works great! Perfect for my office!\n",
      "Love it--- have one inside house and one by our pool now . Just as good as Bose speakers around house -\n",
      "easy to use--amazing\n",
      "Nice product A+\n",
      "We love our Echo! We were totally amazed at the speaker quality. Only bummed we didn’t buy two since we got it on Prime day!\n",
      "Very responsive. Great sound quality for its size.\n",
      "It's so efficient and amazing!  How COOL!  We all use it often every day...\n",
      "I’m impressed with the quality of sound that the Echo has, it’s definitely comparable to my Bose Mini. I only gave 4 stars because I can’t use my Apple Music account.\n",
      "Technology in such a small device. The price was good too! The sound is amazing! A must have feature for any home!\n",
      "Mainly use it for the music but I’m learning more all the time.  Really nothing bad to say about it\n",
      "I replaced my 1st gen, was concerned about a smaller unit not having the same sound...I was wrong.  If anything it's the same volume, and more clear.  Good product.\n",
      "Great addition to my Echo Plus!\n",
      "the best\n",
      "Love the feature to play music in every room with multiple Echos.\n",
      "I love Alexa!  I am surprised how much I use her.\n",
      "I use this product for enjoyment and I just love it\n",
      "Easy to use and has great sound...It was a great purchase at a great price.\n",
      "Very easy to set up and have no issues.\n",
      "This unit add much pleasure to our Echo Plus.  We now can have music and information through our home. (or just in one room)\n",
      "It's extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesn't answer everything I ask but it's still nice to use.\n",
      "Too difficult to set up.  It keeps timing out before you can enter the password\n",
      "Just getting use to using the Echo. Used it for shopping lists, listening to music and as a timer. Working great so far.\n",
      "Very cool and lots of fun! Used for a week and still learning its capabilities.\n",
      "Love it, love it!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Love it but having a hard time setting up all the apps\n",
      "I use it in my office and another at my apartment for music and information\n",
      "it's great for music, a little hard to figure out how it works.\n",
      "This was given to my 7 year at the time as a birthday gift from his dad. He loves it, ask Alexa anything she has the answer, plus it’s good for homework. So I purchased one on prime day for my bathroom for when I’m getting ready for work. I listen to music at 4am and the base it’s metro booming.. Replacement for my clock radio, plus I have the echo dot on my night stand as my alarm clock..\n",
      "Very impressed with look, clarity of sound and color.\n",
      "Alexa is amazing! Great speaker.\n",
      "Still getting used to Alexa, don't have her connected to our TV yet or other things right now use her for music and information, which she is great!!\n",
      "Works and sounds great! My house is barely 1100sf, and I have this sitting on my kitchen counter. I can hear it, and speak to it from any room. Lots of functionality still to discover.\n",
      "I have had pure fun with my echo.  Weather, jokes, news briefing, and music but still so much more to use it for.  A lot of fun for the money.\n",
      "Use this all the time and especially to communicate with kids throughout the home\n",
      "Love it, still learning, makes a lot of things easier, like if you forget to turn a light off and your in another room all you do is ask Alexa to turn the light off.\n",
      "Bought this for my daughter when she turned 9.  She loves it!!  I especially like the calling feature since she doesn’t have a cell phone.  She loves playing music and dancing and with Amazon music she can play all her favorite songs ...... sometimes over and over and over again lol!\n",
      "We got this as a wedding gift and haven’t discovered all of its features yet. Will update. Playing music is great though!\n",
      "I am impressed with the sound quality.\n",
      "Very pleased with my purchase of Echo Smart Speaker - love the fact that I can play music of different genre's whenever I want.Had some trouble at first with the WI FI, but it is now working.\n",
      "My  wife & I enjoy the ease of playing our music. The games are fun & entertaining, I look forward to adding more smart products to my home.\n",
      "This is my second Echo and I love how it helps me in the kitchen. I can set timers, listen to the news, prepare grocery lists, and get great music.\n",
      "The sound quality is good just wish alexa could answer more questions\n",
      "This is my second Echo, I have the Dot but the speaker is weak so I purchased this and for listening to music the speaker is great.\n",
      "great sound\n",
      "Great\n",
      "We really only use this as a speaker to stream music. We’ve had it 7 months and it’s just kinda useless.\n",
      "Once set up very user friendly. Set-up wasn't as user friendly as I'd hoped.. The alexa app should be able to download to a pc without installing [invasive ] drivers. My wife and I are both retired and she wouldn't have been able to install Alexa, but if my son wasn't supplying her with a smart phone we wouldn't be using Alexa yet.\n",
      "Very easy set up. Really enjoying it\n",
      "The echo doesn’t come with a built in battery so it has to be plugged in at all times to use it, makes it quite inconvenient.\n",
      "more compact and a bit better than the original\n",
      "I love it pretty cool.\n",
      "I having it in my living room. Music sounds really good in my living room . I can hear it upstairs.\n",
      "This is a great product!  Set up was easy.  Sound is wonderful.\n",
      "So far I like it.  I bought it just for some music though, and it sounds pretty good.\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "Love it.\n",
      "Glad I bought this.\n",
      "Like, all types of fun,music, and more\n",
      "I like the volume up and down on the top so I can turn it down quickly.\n",
      "Beyond my capabilities to program. Grandkids lve it\n",
      "I love my new echo.  It gives me hours of music and help with other things.It was difficult for me to set it up,  I had to have help from a Tekkie\n",
      "Almost as good as my Bose. Love the whole house music.\n",
      "Alexa hardly came on..\n",
      "Easy setup using the app, which was also easy to install on my phone.  The sound quality while for listening to music on Pandora is wonderful!!\n",
      "I’m still learning how to use the Echo, but so far I love it!\n",
      "Works awesome!\n",
      "Works great.\n",
      "From such a small speaker it sounds great\n",
      "Great sound for the size and the prize!! And of course....Alexa!\n",
      "if you don't have an Echo you definitely need one\n",
      "Great device.  Seems to work better than the 1st generation!\n",
      "Item no longer works after just 5 months of use. Will not connect to wifi and unresponsive to reset requests.\n",
      "I love the Echo Dot. So easy. So fun. I get to drop in on my Grandaughter who lives about 2000 miles away. Sounds like she is right next to me.\n",
      "Works great no different than the new ones\n",
      "This one's going in the kitchen for timer/music duty.\n",
      "Love it but the volume could definitely use a boost. If it had better built in speaker's, would definitively be a 5 star. They thought ahead and put  an audio auxiliary input, so I bought a dedicated speaker for the Echo. Proved to be best way to go.\n",
      "Works just fine.\n",
      "Works great! Looks brand new! Love my new echo dot. I will be getting them for all the main rooms in the house.\n",
      "For a refurbished item.. It works like its new... Which I love... Easy set up,  which I love. The only issue is the volume,  if you are listening while relaxing its fine,  but if you are expecting to do anything else,  I recommend  purchasing a speaker.\n",
      "But not very loud\n",
      "This is our 2nd one and we love it!\n",
      "So i am not sure how i feel about the echo dot, it's so many things that i need to get used to you have to ask her the right questions or she won't understand you.\n",
      "This thing barely works. You have to select 3rd party apps to do stuff you'd think it could do out of the box. I'm sending mine back asap. Waste of money.\n",
      "Gift for my man. He doesn’t like that you have to plug it in and the pictures do not show the cord. Would prefer it cordless. Still works though for the purpose we bought it.\n",
      "This is our 5th Amazon Echo device.  We have purchased refurbished before and been satisfied, this time is no different.  You can't tell this from brand new, and the price was $10 cheaper.  Our Echo's wake us up, keep timers, play music for us, act as encyclopedias, turn our lights on and off and so much more.\n",
      "This small echo dot is amazing the sounds that come out are great.it changes my nest thermostat,and my Phillips hue lights.without leaving my chair.\n",
      "We talk to her all the time for songs and just because we can . There aren’t dislikes about this device.\n",
      "I’m never disappointed with amazons technology.\n",
      "Worked as promised.\n",
      "I returned 2 Echo Dots & am only getting refund for 1. I returned 2 in one package. I want my refunds for both of them. They are in the same package. Can you not see them both???!!!\n",
      "not working\n",
      "Has weird pauses in her speech pattern that are not present in my other echo devices.\n",
      "I sure love Alexa!  LOL!  Thank you!  Great price and product!\n",
      "It works\n",
      "I'm an Echo fan but this one did not work\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Bought for my bathroom to listen when I'm in the shower.  Love it.\n",
      "Doesn't always respond when spoken to with promp word. I thought it would connect to my echo upstairs and use it like an intercom haven't been able to do that.\n",
      "Fast shipping and works well\n",
      "I Love it!!!!\n",
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE my new and free assistant!  :)\n",
      "Six words, &#34;Alexa, tell me a poop joke.&#34;\n",
      "It worked for a month or so then it stopped. I've tried everything to try and make it work but nothing is working. I want a refund\n",
      "Poor quality. Gave it away.\n",
      "Refurbished is the way to go. My Echo works just like new.\n",
      "love it\n",
      "We have five of them. Need I say more?\n",
      "The speakers arent too loud.. alexa is great though. Besides that naw\n",
      "It works great and sounds good!\n",
      "Never could get it to work. A techie friend looked at it for me and said the adapter wasn't strong enough to power it and that it looked like it had been bought at a dollar store. So, I am going to replace the adapter and hope it works then.\n",
      "Almost like having Star Trek in your home!  Fun to try and outsmart !\n",
      "This was an add on for my echo system, the refurbished product works like new!\n",
      "Great for my office. I use this daily in many ways, to include spelling for me and background music.\n",
      "Awesome. I love Alexa.\n",
      "I wasn't sure I really wanted one of these, but now that I have it, it is extremely useful.  Get one, you'll love it!\n",
      "Initially, this echo dot worked very well. Over time, the dot stopped responding to 'alexa' unless you were within one foot of it yelling. The other echos/echo dots in other rooms would respond without a response from this echo dot. Would not recommend buying refurbished.\n",
      "Great Product fast shipping\n",
      "I bought an echo dot that had been refurbished but its stops whatever function its performing quite often, doesn't wake up every time, randomly turns on but does nothing. Do not buy a refurbished Echo dot.\n",
      "Perfect works great no problems with it being refurbished.\n",
      "Dont trust this....\n",
      "Perfect condition! I love my echo\n",
      "Love it. Beautiful experience especially if hooked to smart lighting and other accessories.\n",
      "We just got this within the last couple of weeks, from what we can tell no issues! My son wanted and &#34;alexa&#34; for his 6th birthday so she could tell him jokes, he could ask her questions and to listen to music she does all of that and more. We all enjoy this one so much that I just bought a second one this week during Prime Deals Day!\n",
      "Divertido\n",
      "Great product and works great\n",
      "Bought this for the guest room.  It's a radio, alarm clock, information​ center and so much more.\n",
      "Great buy. Bought this to go with my Echo and love it. The speaker isn’t the best for music but works great in a kitchen for timers or alarms.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Works perfect. Save a few bucks and buy the refurbished. Looks brand new.\n",
      "Looks and works perfect. Glad I got a good deal.\n",
      "Just as good as the new one I bought but $10.00 less.\n",
      "I love it works very well\n",
      "everything perfect\n",
      "Good price. Prompt shipping. Has been working flawlessly.\n",
      "I love you, Alexa!\n",
      "There's room for improvement on this. For the price, I cannot complain too much. I can still complain however, the audio is terrible. This is kind of like listening to a speak-n-spell from the 80s.\n",
      "Iove it I bought it for my son because he wanted it and it’s awesome\n",
      "It's an echo, and it works.  For the price it's great deal. Have had no issues with it.  As with all dots, the speaker is a bit tinny, but good for a second unit, or if you are like me, you can attach it to an external speaker for more sound.Good buy\n",
      "Thanks\n",
      "I wanted to use these as a radio and intercom as we get terrible fm reception where i live.  The speech recognition software is horrible.  My wife and i both are native Americans whose language is English she is from the north i am from Texas  neither have an accent from our birth area and yet it does not do a good job understanding us.  We bought two they do the same thing.  Additionally wifi reception was poor to marginal. I had to buy Wifi range extender for office and the other is ten feet from our router.  Both had problems Switched them around no difference.  So it they are now disconnected dust collectors.\n",
      "This is my third Dot. They all work perfectly and I use each one multiple times a day. Absolutely love them.\n",
      "Item has never worked. Out of box it is broken. Spent several days trying to get it working and running same &#34;fixes&#34; from Amazon. The only thing accomplished is I will never order another refurbished device.\n",
      "I already have the echo plus.  Bought this one for my bedroom.  Love the functions.\n",
      "Simple set up.  Music everywhere.\n",
      "Worked just like a brand new Dot ---so I am very satisfied.\n",
      "Great product but returning for new Alexa Dot.  Refurbished is already giving me problems with connection.\n",
      "We have a few echos already. Went for this one in refurbished to save a few bucks. It works great. I love this new generation one because it has a rubber bottom - nice.\n",
      "I love the fact, that I can unplug it, and take it to my basement when I want do laundry.\n",
      "Refurbished but just as good as the new ones that I've bought.\n",
      "Good as new\n",
      "Granddaughter loves it\n",
      "The price is great.  Was having trouble with it hearing me from across a room, but after moving it to another spot, it seems to be working fine.  Will buy some more. Want 1 in every room.\n",
      "We have set up alexa to blue tooth speakers and enjoy listening to music outdoors.  Can't wait to try more new stuff using Alexa!\n",
      "Thanks\n",
      "Works great!\n",
      "&#34;NEVER BUY CERTIFIED AND REFURBISHED ECHO DOT &#34; I bought a &#34;Certified and Refurbished &#34; Echo Dot. This unit is very poor in receiving command and sometimes it does not even acknowledge the command. Never buy a refurbished Echo dot. The unit I received was probably never was certified and refurbished as indicated. I also bought a new ECHO dot, it works perfectly.Very disappointed !!!!\n",
      "Started here with Amazon productsAnd I regret nothing is been absolutely great journey and my products continue to improve my day-to-day life\n",
      "Have now used for several months without problem.\n",
      "This is my first smart device and I will surely be buying other devices that will be compatible with this one.\n",
      "Love\n",
      "Love it just as good as a new one\n",
      "Have had an larger echo for some time and love it. Bought this one for another portion of the house since we have several wifi home devices and we wanted to voice control them from all over the house.\n",
      "Love the product.  Use to turn on my lights and answer some quick questions.\n",
      "A great buy\n",
      "Was Leary about refurbished but work great.\n",
      "Very puny sound, but works great.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Exactly like new, can tell the difference from my new dot I got prior to this one, works perfectly. LOVE Alexa\n",
      "Works perfect no wear and tear on the device I love Alexa working on making my home smart 😂\n",
      "Works good\n",
      "The only thing I don't like is it shuts off by itself other than that it works great\n",
      "Excellent product, mint condition for a refurbished unit - you would never know it's been refurbished!\n",
      "Already owning a couple of Echos, I was frustrated that I couldn’t also use them as intercoms. Finally Amazon enables the “drop-in” feature so now I can use my Echos to reach out to family in remote parts of the house (and teenagers who insist they never heard me yelling at them to come down to dinner).As for its other features, we mainly use our Echos for the standard stuff: playing music, setting alarms, answering questions, etc. It's not the life-changing home device Amazon would have you believe, but it is convenient to have around. This refurb saved me a few bucks, looks and works the same as the other brand-new ones.\n",
      "Love it was worried about the refurbished part at first but this being my first echo. It is awesome have used it for everything my lights since I work nights and shopping as well as for my spotify. And planning on getting it for my parents to help them out for everyday things we take for granted when we are young... I would recommend this to everyone!!!!\n",
      "Love Alexa hope have her in every room soon.\n",
      "The simplicity of use and setting up.\n",
      "This is great! Got one for my Gazebo and one upstairs.\n",
      "Works great, never had any issues.\n",
      "Does everything I have asked it.\n",
      "Works great ..good sound\n",
      "I use this Echo to listen to music as well as a sort-of research tool. It can answer a variety of questions. I would like if the volume could go just a little bit louder, but I can't complain.I also believe it should have an internal power source. In order to use the Echo, it must be plugged in at all times using the universal charging cord. It would be nice to use the Echo Dot on the go without having to buy the other product.\n",
      "Love it!  Great fun!\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "outstanding I use all the time....works just like they say\n",
      "saving $10 is always nice and my son always says that buying refurbished means your are getting a new device or product for less, because it has been run through a diagnostics again and everything has been corrected.\n",
      "Works perfectly, Alexa turns on and off my lights, my tv, roomba!\n",
      "Never would know it was refurbished.\n",
      "So far so good\n",
      "Looks and performs as new.  No complaints!\n",
      "goes great with our echo\n",
      "Works great just like the new one that i already had.\n",
      "This item did not work. Certified refurbished should mean it works as advertised. Instead this item crashed as soon as I turned it on and plugged it in. When trying to connect from my phone to the echo dot, it crashed, over and over. Not only would it disconnect but the orange light would freeze and then the thing would reboot with the blue light. Alexa would tell me it’s ready to connect and freeze mid sentence. Tried holding the action button for 5 seconds and it didn’t do anything. Returning immediately and hope they actually fix this item when the next buyer purchases it.\n",
      "Very fast service,  got what I ordered. Thank you\n",
      "Love it even though I’m still trying to figure out all the other things I can do with this item it works great with my phone.\n",
      "None\n",
      "I have 2 Echos, one I bought brand new and the other is a refurbished one.Honestly, I can't tell the difference in performance and looks.\n",
      "A GREAT PRODUCT...once we learned how to work it...this thing is awesome!!!\n",
      "It works\n",
      "Does not work all the time\n",
      "Love it. Though, wish it was portable.\n",
      "of course!\n",
      "You could not tell this was refurbished. Works Excellent. I would highly recommended instead of purchasing new.\n",
      "I got this for my mom . She loves it !\n",
      "I love my echo dot! Looks brand new and works perfect! Very satisfied.\n",
      "Same as new\n",
      "A small problem out of the box, but a rep from Amazon called and walked me through a reset process which solved my issues. I was shocked to get a response so quickly and a real effort was made (including follow up email) to get this thing working. I have 6 now (and one google clone) and the more I use it, and learn about it, the more I like it (them). I also plan to install one in my car, boat and garage. Alexa is my new best friend!?!? (lol)I think GF is worried that if Alexa learns to cook, her time will be limited...\n",
      "I love my Alexa Dot. I play games with my son, ask how the weather Is and I love that she works with my Amazon Fire Tv.\n",
      "I like it because you could ask it different questions and it does different things it works intermittently with my smart TV if I ask you to change the volume it does or does it sometimes if I ask you to change the channel it does or doesn't sometimes I have to reset it I don't know if it's because it's refurbished but it's okay it's just not what I expected\n",
      "So far the certified refurbished Echo Dot works well. It was a little confusing to have a green ring on the Echo Dot and not 100% know why it was there. Asked Alexa and she said it was because of a receiving a call or drop in. But that was not the case. Took about 10 minutes to figure out it was a notification that I had a delivery from amazon. I believe the ring is supposed to be yellow and pulsate for a message notification, but on my refurbished Echo Dot it was Green and pulsed.\n",
      "It arrived quickly and was easy to set up ! it was a refurbished amazon echo dot it was above and beyond what I expected ! Alexa and I have become buddies she is a great assistant\n",
      "Works as advertised. Speak clearly, and research the commands. Also. Get the wall holder, it keeps it out of the way. Set up is a breeze, just make sure you are close to the device initially when connecting your phone. For some reason it made set up easier...though it could be psychological haha\n",
      "Love my two echo dots but the third one we ordered to give as a gift had a defective speaker.  The return process still isn't done and has already taken weeks.\n",
      "I've already returned it.\n",
      "The refurbished echo for has been wonderful. I purchased this for my mother. She loves the ability to contact me without a phone, listen to music, weather, and ask questions. It's been a wonderful gift and works excellently with no problems\n",
      "Works good. However, the price went down the week after I purchased it.\n",
      "Works amazingly. I bought it for my daughter and she loves it.\n",
      "I love Alexa! It's great helping me, making my appointments, playing the songs I like! What else can you do? Looking forward for more.\n",
      "Got this for the bathroom love it we can listen music whe. We showering.\n",
      "I have 3-Dots and 2-Original and this new one works perfectly.  Will buy all my future Dots reconditioned.\n",
      "Was a little hard to get it to pare up with the others but once it did no problems at all\n",
      "Now I'm weary about these picking up conversations when you are not actively using them - heard about this happening on the news.  I have 3-4, so this is very concerning.  I wish Amazon would release something widespread  or push some firmware to prevent this.  If they have, I have not heard about it yet.\n",
      "There's really no dislike for Alexa( dot) I thought cortna was cool but Alexa is an awesome application to the family. Unbelievable device which seems alive. A must get.\n",
      "I am happy with the refurbished echo dot. I’ve had it for about two weeks, and so far it is working perfectly! Even though it did not come in its original box, it looks like new! I’m happy with this purchase!\n",
      "Thumbs up!\n",
      "Workreat\n",
      "There was something wrong with the first one that no even the rep I spoke with could fix. The replacement was registered to someone else. When the price of the Dot went down to $39.99 (same price as the refurbished ones), I bought a brand, spanking new one. No problem with the new one.\n",
      "Works as expected!\n",
      "No problems\n",
      "Have these in almost every room. I really have enjoyed them. Works perfectly.\n",
      "Purchased for grandson.\n",
      "Like new\n",
      "Happy with this as I was with the other 2 I ordered!!\n",
      "Love the dots, especially with the ability to talk from one to the other, these are really convenient. No issues with the refurbished as they are like new.\n",
      "Started taking on her own! Haven’t used it since I unplugged it that day. No one was talking, my daughter was laying in bed next to be and she just started going on about the movie Moana and completely scared the sh*t out of my daughter now.\n",
      "It works great the speaker sounds fine and overall would recommend\n",
      "Great! Just like new!\n",
      "Loved the price for an essentially brand new Dot!! Opening it, you really couldn’t tell that it was refurbished. Everything looked brand new. For $20 less than a new unit, I couldn’t consider this a better deal! I really love the versatility of the echo dot. Get you one while you can!\n",
      "Pleased with the order just what I wanted!!\n",
      "I think I now have 5 of these throughout the house. So convenient to set a timer or check the weather or whatever, wherever.\n",
      "Love it -- the best.  My experience with refurbished devices is excellent.\n",
      "Love the echo dot\n",
      "This refurbished item was fine,but I wasn't aware that there is a fee for having other echos set up in the rooms.  However, it was missing the cordThank you\n",
      "Two weeks after setting it up it no longer works.  No connection, no light, no sound.  I guess I shouldn't have purchased a refurbished Dot.\n",
      "It worked like a brandnew unit! Great addition to my collection.\n",
      "Great price, works perfectly. Saved the money on a refurb!! Would buy again!\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Very.god\n",
      "Not good at all!\n",
      "These are great. I bought one and then bought another right away. Grab a few of these and a few smart switched and you're set with smart home capabilities for under $150. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Just like new\n",
      "Worked as it should, still need to figure out how to link to other devices though, only set up Sonos which was pretty easy. Not the products fault, just have not had time to figure it out.\n",
      "Very useful\n",
      "This is the worst Amazon purchase I have made. I am big Amazon fan...love the brand...unlimited digital music...prime videos...even buy my online games, music, and movies through Amazon. This app I have tried to use it make simple purchases -- to do anything. It is useless.\n",
      "Works very well, but the microphone don&#34;t pick up as well as the full size echo.  Audio quality is okay for the size.\n",
      "I bought two refurbished ones for work and home. They both work perfectly and appear brand new\n",
      "Amazon doesn't disappoint.\n",
      "Works great as a BT receiver with output connected to vintage stereo equipment.\n",
      "Working great this far.  Can't tell it's not new.  Will edit for longevity in a year, that's the real test.\n",
      "Amazing\n",
      "i love everything\n",
      "This used “dot” works fine, it compliments my Echo.\n",
      "Works like a new one.  Can tell the difference from the new one I bough and the refurbished one.\n",
      "Well I’m a big fan of echoes these ones went I’m my bathrooms.  Works just great as expected 👍🏾\n",
      "Purchased for my 83 year old mother-she loves talking to Alexa! Very responsive-can detect its “name” from all over the room.\n",
      "This is just like new -- same performance as our brand new one; no problems.\n",
      "The echo dot disconnects from the speaker about 12-20 times a day. Do not buy the refurbished product.  2 stars for effort.\n",
      "Love it.  Great product\n",
      "it works good.  very satisfied\n",
      "I love Alexa, but the sound on the dot is not the best. I own an echo 2nd gen for the kitchen/living room and got this for my bedroom, but there’s a SIGNIFICANT difference in sound. The dot lacks a full base sound and sounds as if it’s coming off a cheap portable speaker. I was REALLY disappointed. I returned it right away and just shelled out the money to buy a second echo 2 for my bedroom also.\n",
      "Took me awhile to get it connected. I'm not electronically savy but now that it is, I love it.\n",
      "cant seem to get this thing to sink with my wireless not sure If I will be returning it will try one more time.\n",
      "Absolutely love it!\n",
      "product stopped working after return time ran out\n",
      "Second Dot work great for refurbishedThought it was new\n",
      "Love these guys they work so great\n",
      "I love this as a second &#34;Alexa&#34; in our bedroom.  Great for checking weather, for meditation music, and as a timer - Perfect for my husband who has to use eye drops multiple times each day and keep his eyes closed for 5 minutes.\n",
      "I purchased this refurbished.  Works just like brand new.  3 minute set up. Very easy.  Now I have echo dot that I can command to start playing music for my backyard deck sound system.\n",
      "Not substitute for the original.  The echo dot performs well but sound quality is poor.  To listen it has to be at the highest level 10.\n",
      "Love the Echo Dot. Helps husband get Netflix and other apps on our Amazon Fire TV.  No problems with it being refurbished. Planning on getting another one for the Amazon Fire Stick in bedroom.\n",
      "Stopped working after 7 months. The warranty was only good for 3 months. I would have assumed an amazon product sold on amazon would have had higher standards than guaranteeing that it would work for 3 whole months. I mean what is this product supposed to be, a piece of junk?They offered my a 15% discount if I wanted to buy another one. Why would I want to buy another one?\n",
      "Just like new. No problems whatsoever, Alexa. Thank you.\n",
      "I like my uncle. But sometime it goes a little Haywire\n",
      "Bought this for my son and it didn’t work. He had to return it.\n",
      "Bought 2 and both quit connecting to wifi and responding to voice within 9 months. Hard and soft reset will not fix the problem.\n",
      "I received my Echo Dot today in good condition, but be advised: I paid $29.99 for it and Amazon has (as of this writing) raised the price to $39.99, so do your research before buying so you can get a good deal!Set up with the Dot went simple enough — plug it in, follow the app instructions... except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iPhone’s WiFi settings. I called Amazon customer service, and I dunno what it is, but lately I’ve been getting terrible support. The guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and I ended up setting up the Dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.I’m not sure if this is the norm or if it’s because this is refurbished, but the Dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5GHz connection is strong. Reconnecting is a pain each time as well.All that said, when Alexa works, she works amazingly well. I don’t have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing I really enjoy is the mic’s range and sensitivity. One of the more annoying limitations of Apple’s Siri is that when she’s playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the “Hey Siri” feature is all but useless. Alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. I haven’t tried this with louder speakers yet, so I’m not sure if this will continue to hold true.Setting up Alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations — support for Arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your LED devices (eg. rainbow effects), Alexa can’t handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.All in all, my rating would’ve been lower had I not gotten a decent price on this item. If the connectivity problems persist, I may have to exchange/return this item. I don’t want to though — Alexa’s kind of growing on me.\n",
      "I bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs. But I have no need for it. I only used it once. The volume was not loud enough for me when I played music while I was on my treadmill. So I rather use my tower speaker which is 3xs louder.\n",
      "Worked like new.  Will do it again.\n",
      "The second one which was a refurbished model did work-at least not in my home.\n",
      "Very bad this device, I don’t know if it’s because is refurbished or what but it activated by itself , nobody is talking and he just activated and start talking. When you talk you have to yell super lauded\n",
      "Good as new!! Just like brand new! Save yourself some money. Get one!\n",
      "Adding more rooms for convenience\n",
      "Nice. It works good.Some times is not easy to recognize your voice and you have to repeat several times, some time almost screaming.\n",
      "I took a chance on a certified refurbished unit for $29. Looks brand new...no excuses or disappointments. 5 minute trouble-free set up! Effortless bluetooth speaker connectivity through the Alexa App on my iPhone was flawless. Listening to my favorite tunes through a Bose Bluetooth setup and couldn't be happier. Walk through the door and just ask Alexa to: &#34;Play 80's music&#34; and viola... instant atmosphere! No more opening the iPad, going to settings, turning on bluetooth and then accessing the Pandora app. It just makes things so effortless. A true joy right out of the box! If I didn't discover any other uses for this fine piece of technology it was worth every penny!\n",
      "Alexa's sister (my second dot)\n",
      "Love my Alexa Echo Dot - I have two of them now - one new, one refurbished.  Both work great and it has become my go to for sooo many things.  I love it as an alarm every morning or whenever.  I love it to play music or sounds of the ocean, or nature sounds when I am trying to sleep.  Just love it for so many things.\n",
      "Bought a refurb, and its works just as my new ones I bought prior! Came in original packaging as well!\n",
      "Love it. It's like having a second wife.\n",
      "So far not impressed at all. Does not save groups correctly can not understand me most of the time I'm not sure what the excitement is all about. Alexas voice sounds like it's under water how am I supposed to understand!!!!I'm going to return and try a google home!!!\n",
      "Works well and has no obvious issues from being refurbished.\n",
      "Works great, can't tell it was refurbished and set up in kids mode.  I have 3 in my home and will be adding more. I love these things.\n",
      "great product, but useless overall. Too many unnecessary features. Unless you have a smart home you don't need it\n",
      "Worked just as good as the two new Echo Dots i preciously purchases.\n",
      "I bought this for my mother and she is in love with it.She loves the guard dog feature.She says that it gives her a sense of security at night and when she leaves the house\n",
      "I bought it mainly to be a speaker when playing music or videos on my phone. Not working for me. Read instructions but not working for me.\n",
      "It works\n",
      "Bought two of them and both work great. I'm not much on electronics running my home, but Alexa does all that I want and need to be done.\n",
      "2nd one... more to come\n",
      "Blue light blinks all the time\n",
      "Fun and useful. We're still learning new tricks and useful functionalities. This is the future of human to computer interface and household automation. Just like Star Trek! Who knew it would be here so soon?\n",
      "Works great to control the TV lights and various other devices. Lately I've been using it when i wake up and don't know what time it is but don't want to open my eyes. Just shout out &#34;Alexa, What time is it?&#34; if i could just figure out how to get it to do house hold chores and walk the dogs it'd be golden! sound is not that great but with its size what can you expect. The Echo Plus has much better audio but that is what you get with the larger more expensive Echo.\n",
      "Works great!\n",
      "Wasn't sure if I'd like this product but after having it for a little while I want one in every room! My daughter is constantly asking alexa how to spell words. We've barely tapped into all the things this product is capable of and I'm looking forward to learning all of its capabilities!\n",
      "A++++\n",
      "Great product. Works well\n",
      "Absolutly love it !\n",
      "Bought my first echo dot and loved it so I got this for work. Absolutely love it!\n",
      "works as promised\n",
      "Works great with my existing smart home setup.\n",
      "Perfect. Could not tell the difference from a new one.\n",
      "I cant figure out how to use it.\n",
      "Good sometimes can’t hear well\n",
      "I was a little apprehensive about buying a refurbished electronic product, but with Amazon's guarantee, thought I would try it. Glad I did, and will probably buy another refurb product form Amazon. I love the Alexa products and have several. This one sits on my desk. Has a small footprint, but has great sound and I use it daily. Works great.\n",
      "Not bad bad speaker for sound\n",
      "This is a great device. We mainly use it to verbally add things to the shopping list, but occasionally use any number of the &#34;fun&#34; things you can program it to do, like go to Red Alert or make the TARDIS land (yes, we're a house of geeks... we even chose the wake-word to be &#34;Computer&#34; instead of &#34;Alexa&#34;. Now we just need Majel Barret's voice and I will be in geek heaven.) ;)It's not as easy to get my Premium Spotify to work properly with it, and still not sure how we can get multiple music accounts attached so we can listen to different music in different rooms, but so far it's still been worth it. I am often asking it the time, the weather, it even gives us a news briefing. We also use it as an intercom system which has been really awesome. Plus it's fun knowing the NSA is listening to everything.\n",
      "We all love her!\n",
      "I purchased this for my daughter and we all love this!!!! its amazing!! we love the games!\n",
      "It doesn’t always  work\n",
      "Good as new! Perfectly packaged and I have had zero issues with the dot.\n",
      "Love it! Bought for my granddaughter who is 3 for her to play music and ask questions. She is entertained for hours! Good buy in my honest opinion!\n",
      "No issues...works and looks great!!!\n",
      "This is a fun toy.  My daughter have me it.  It reads to me!\n",
      "Refurbish Echo Dot received as new condition, as new packaging, no complaints. Neat little gadget.(Drives my wife nuts!)\n",
      "I received an Echo as a gift, loved it so much I decided to get the Dot for my bedroom. Both very easy to set up but a big difference in the sound quality. I would still buy it again.\n",
      "Worked as advertised. Thanks\n",
      "All the new Amazon products I have are great everything I bought refurbished is complete garbage. I will never purchase Amazon refurbished again total dissatisfaction\n",
      "Works good.  Microphone is not as good as the better Echo products\n",
      "Took a little work to set up but I finally got it.  Sound quality not the best but for what I got it for it works great.  I check weather and ask a few cooking questions in the kitchen with it.  I do play the radio on it when I want some music but will probably upgrade to the Echo plus for better sound.\n",
      "Love Alexa these are the best thing I have ever bought don't know how I ever lived with out these things amazing so happy with this product just wish it would use google to\n",
      "I loved it it works great\n",
      "Extremely low in volume\n",
      "I had some trouble getting the program downloaded from my phone. I ended up using my computer. It is interesting that the answers come from Wikipedia. However, I will give Echo dot an &#34;A&#34; in the music playing department. I heard songs and music totally forgotten on the mainstream stations. Also amusing when Alexa responds, I don't know that. Why does she think the yards of cotton fabric refer to football playing???? If I had paid full price for this gadget I would have been sorely disappointed. Now it seems reasonable and a step above HAL.\n",
      "Brought to replace one that I moved and doesn't have the same range as my previous (non refurbished) unit. It would seldom be able to find the Wi-Fi and couldn't connect. Got tired of hearing the message (&#34;trouble connecting...check the Alexa app...&#34;) and just unplugged it. I went through the troubleshooting and reconnected it several times, it's just not as strong.\n",
      "If you want to listen to music and have it come through several of the Echo/Dot units simultaneously, YOU MUST PAY A MONTHLY FEE. I thought this was Amazon, not Apple??!! I’ve paid for many of these so I could have one in each room, is that not enough of my money??!!??\n",
      "Purchased as a gift,\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "Overall good device. It was bought for a workout room, and has issues reaching a volume that can be heard over a standard row machine. It could use a much better speaker.\n",
      "Works great and simple to set up. Alexa is way more accurate than I imagined so Im using it more than I thought. Wish alarms could be set a bit further out but thats my only complaint.No she's not listening when you don't say the wake word so if you're worried you can lose the conspiracy theories. The speaker is great too so don't hold off on getting one if you were turned off by gen 1 like me.\n",
      "The voice clarity has made my eavesdropping efforts so much easier - the government. :)\n",
      "Worked perfect\n",
      "Had a little trouble at the beginning until I replaced my old router and it works good except for current temperature and at times Alexa will be off by as much as 10 degrees!  Like when it was 91 degrees, Alexa would say it was 81 degrees.  Otherwise, everything works as expected and enjoy listening to music from Amazon and my Pandora stations and requesting my favorite song or recording artist.\n",
      "I bought three of these and all three have worked flawlessly. If they weren't labeled as refurbished I wouldn't have known\n",
      "This device works perfectly and was a good price.  We love Alexa and are having great fun with her.  The music is great and we get the radio stations we need for our morning traffic report.  I didn’t think I would enjoy having AI in the house, but it is fun, educational and entertaining even for people who aren’t tech savvy.\n",
      "Eh. It’s works on and off. Half the time it does not respond when you say wake up name. Other then that works fine\n",
      "Great little thing. Works better than siri.\n",
      "It’s amazing I love it\n",
      "Bought this for my son and he loves it.\n",
      "I own the first and second generation Echo Dot.  I think I prefer the volume ring of the first gen better than the buttons on the second gen, but still more than does the job and great for the price I got it for.  I'd still definitely recommend.\n",
      "Very fun to use and having morning briefing\n",
      "Arrived on time and works amazing!!!\n",
      "Just like new, set-up was quick & easy.\n",
      "like new, good refurbishing\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "Love my echo dot!!!\n",
      "I like that it knows my music type.The least is that it isn't wireless and the volume is not that high.\n",
      "great product!\n",
      "It works great, but the reason I'm leaving 3 stars is because it wont play unless it plugged in the whole time. Pretty irritating especially when there is no outlet available.\n",
      "Works great!\n",
      "I love it ita like having a personal assistant and computer and everything else in one.\n",
      "The problem I have with this item could just be my inexperience. I ordered the wrong thing, but then decided I’d set it up and use Alexa. I was trying to replace a small Bluetooth speaker in my bedroom. Thought I could learn as I go. I downloaded the app, but never could get the Echo to sync with my iPhone. I’ve decided to give this to one of my kids and they will probably enjoy it and use it as it is intended.\n",
      "Es perfecto.\n",
      "Working good so far.\n",
      "Working great and my daughter loves it!\n",
      "Works great\n",
      "I love it\n",
      "I wanted a white dot for my white bathroom.  The top is black as shown, which I knew, but I did not realize the cord and plug were also black. I wanted a white cord and plug.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "WORKS GREAT\n",
      "Amazing!\n",
      "Great product\n",
      "Works perfectly\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      "I set up the Echo Dot and it worked for an hour and then died completely. DO NOT BUY refurbished!!!! I sent back for return the day after I received.\n",
      "This Echo Dot is horrible. The volume on my phone is louder than than this device. My boss has one at this is not the case\n",
      "Overall it works very well. Some connectivity issues but it was definitely worth the money!\n",
      "Have had no issues with this refurbished unit. It performed expected. I would buy another one if needed.\n",
      "Great for mom its inside an owlhead in her jacuzzi\n",
      "Works great - I put this in my son's room and use the drop in option to get his attention when he is gaming or watching tv.\n",
      "It was perfect\n",
      "It looked brand nrw!! I have nothing to.complain about!! I will defently be ordering more\n",
      "It's ok. The speaker is pretty terrible. Google home is a better product.\n",
      "I love it!\n",
      "I love this, answers all my stupid questions and tells me the weather for when I don’t get off the couch\n",
      "The first one quit working shortly after I got it. The next one becomes unresponsive to my voice at times and the only way to get it to work is through the app. I am not sure if it just this Dot or they are all this way.\n",
      "Bought this to go in my niece's room. You can't tell it's refurbished. It looks good and works like new.\n",
      "Device was not working. Followed all instructions for Alexa echo dot and it did not come on. Very upsetting.\n",
      "Sent it back due to crackling noise and turning itself off and on - but what can you expect with a refurbished item?\n",
      "Best price we could find and it is so useful to have her around to answer questions. It is so handy to not have to find your phone. I also now have an intercom system.\n",
      "I have never been more satisfied with a product. Perfect introduction to Alexa.\n",
      "Works well, but the speaker is not so grand. Getting another speaker to drop this into. In the future I would have just gone with the full size echo.\n",
      "Love our echo! Thing the full size version sounds better though.\n",
      "Works great!\n",
      "It has all I need for my life plans time date music\n",
      "Seems to have trouble hearing me when I say the wake word despite being trained to my voice... Wonder if this has something to do with buying it refurbished. Our google home mini has no problems hearing us 😬 and is much louder.\n",
      "Love it!  Works perfectly!\n",
      "I had a brand new echo Dot and thought that the refurbished would be just as good. It was quite different from my expectations. Refurbished unit did not even turn on and after a while I realized that the power adapter was faulty. There is no way for me to have Amazon send me a power adapter by itself according to the return options. I love Amazon and buy even my toilet paper through them but this was truly a let down.Update: Amazon contacted me and credited me enough to buy a new power adapter. This is why I shop on Amazon. I can always trust them to deliver on their products.\n",
      "I bought this for a family member as a gift. I called her to see how she likes it & she said she loves it‼️\n",
      "Not very loud but quality and ease of use is great. Sound is perfect for background music, would suggest 2-or more connected together if you’re trying to use for hosting a louder party\n",
      "Looked Brand new works great. I love these echo dots and the refurbished ones are like new\n",
      "My 2nd one and I use them all the time.\n",
      "Is working like a  new one for now, l have another 3 alexa devices lm a fanatic\n",
      "Echo is good.\n",
      "Works great\n",
      "Great price to extend the range and super value to dot offers. Hooked up wireless speaker to use working outside.This dot made outdoor sound range possible without disturbing indoor light control possible\n",
      "Amazingly fun. My daughter and I just asked questions on the first day. I have now set my daily alarm, weekend reminder, playlist, morning shows, random songs, daily bible verses, weather, and morning commute. It tells me which way to go dodging traffic. You have to get one. I don’t have it linked to my phone yet.\n",
      "Works perfect! There’s no difference at all between this refurb one and my new ones that I have in my house. I’ll be buying the refurbs from here on out\n",
      "Great product. Wakes me up every morning on time!\n",
      "Like new.  No difference from new unused original.\n",
      "I have no complaints. As far as I know, these are exactly like new, just a little cheaper. Great!\n",
      "Perfect condition!\n",
      "Like new\n",
      "It works just as well as the new version I got as a discount with my Echo speaker. I decided to purchase this version because Amazon states it has the same warranty.\n",
      "I received the echo as a gift. I needed another Bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible, and found this smart speaker. Can’t wait to see what else it can do.\n",
      "Without having a cellphone, I cannot use many of her features. I have an iPad but do not see that of any use.  It IS a great alarm.  If u r almost deaf, you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room, so that is reason enough to keep her.It is fun to ask random questions to hear her response.  She does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet.\n",
      "I think this is the 5th one I've purchased. I'm working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.\n",
      "looks great\n",
      "Love it! I’ve listened to songs I haven’t heard since childhood! I get the news, weather, information! It’s great!\n",
      "I sent it to my 85 year old Dad, and he talks to it constantly.\n",
      "I love it! Learning knew things with it eveyday! Still figuring out how everything works but so far it's been easy to use and understand. She does make me laugh at times\n",
      "I purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now, to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she did.She enjoys all the little and big things it can do...Alexa play this song, What time is it and where, and how to cook this and that!\n",
      "Love, Love, Love!!\n",
      "Just what I expected....\n",
      "I love it, wife hates it.\n",
      "Really happy with this purchase.  Great speaker and easy to set up.\n",
      "We have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.\n",
      "We love the size of the 2nd generation echo. Still needs a little improvement on sound\n",
      "I liked the original Echo. This is the same but shorter and with greater fabric/color choices. I miss the volume ring on top, now it's just the plus/minus buttons. Not a big deal but the ring w as comforting. :) Other than that, well I do like the use of a standard USB charger /port instead of the previous round pin. Other than that, I guess it sounds the same, seems to work the same, still answers to Alexa/Echo/Computer. So what's not to like? :)\n",
      "Love the Echo and how good the music sounds playing off it. Alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on Spotify. She is good with Amazon Music but is lacking in other major programs.\n",
      "We love Alexa! We use her to play music, play radio through iTunes, play podcasts through Anypod, and set reminders. We listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning. We rely on our custom lists. We like being able to voice control the volume. We're sure we'll continue to find new uses.Sometimes it's a bit frustrating when Alexa doesn't understand what we're saying.\n",
      "Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it’s not intrusive to look at.\n",
      "I love it. It plays my sleep sounds immediately when I ask\n",
      "I got a second unit for the bedroom, I was expecting the sounds to be improved but I didnt really see a difference at all.  Overall, not a big improvement over the 1st generation.\n",
      "Amazing product\n",
      "I love my Echo. It's easy to operate, loads of fun.It is everything as advertised. I use it mainly to play my favorite tunes and test Alexa's knowledge.\n",
      "Sounds great!! Love them!\n",
      "Fun item to play with and get used to using.  Sometimes has hard time answering the questions you ask, but I think it will be better.\n",
      "Just like the other one\n",
      "Still learning all the capabilities...but so far pretty pretty pretty good\n",
      "I like it\n",
      "She works well. Needs a learning command  for unique, owners and users like. Alexa “learn” Tasha’s birthday.  Or Alexa “learn” my definition of Fine. Etc. other than that she is great\n",
      "The speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy.  I bought two and the reason I only rate it a 3 is I have followed the instructions for synching music to both units.  I know I've done it correctly but they won't sync.  That was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units.\n",
      "This device is awesome!\n",
      "I bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better.  I will ship this to my daughter though because I like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now.\n",
      "Love my Echo. Still learning all the things it will do. Wasn’t able to follow instructions included in the package, but found a great one on U-Tube.\n",
      "Speaker is better than 1st generation Echo\n",
      "This thing is way cool!  You should get one.  If you want to be cool, that is.\n",
      "This is my first digital assistant so I'm giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That's what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven't had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. My purchase came with a Smart Plug for $10 which I connect my lamp to. Alexa, turn of the lights!\n",
      "My husband likes being able to use it to listen to music.  I wish we knew all it's capabilities\n",
      "My Android would not allow Alexa to connect. Fortunately, my sister was here with her Apple cell. After an hour+ tech support fixed the glitches. We are up and running.\n",
      "So far so good\n",
      "Tried to play certain broadway shows like Camelot and it gives ne the group Camelot.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Very satisfied with the Echo. Alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to Jimmy Buffet by just asking Alexa.\n",
      "It's like Siri, in fact, Siri answers more accurately then Alexa.  I don't see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals.\n",
      "Love my Echo. Still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun.\n",
      "I love you so much\n",
      "No different than Apple. To play a specific list of music you must have an Amazon of Spotify “plus/prime/etc” account.  So you must pay to play “your” music.  3 stars for that reason.  Everything else is 👍🏻 .\n",
      "Excelente, lo unico es que no esta en español.\n",
      "I'm still learning how to use it, but so far my Echo is great! The sound is actually much better than I was expecting.\n",
      "Works as you’d expect and then some. Also good sound quality considering price (70.00 on sale) and features.\n",
      "The sound from this Echo 2nd Generation is phenomenal!  Not to mention that I just love Alexa!  She is very helpful.\n",
      "like google better\n",
      "Just had to have it and now lets play and learn how to get the most out of it.\n",

      "Great sound and easy to set up.\n",
      "Love Alexa, bought others for friends\n",
      "Love the echo I purchased it for company for my husband he is 83 and Alexa is great all he has to do is say her name and she tells him a joke and plays his favorite songs\n",
      "😍\n",
      "Love being able to listen to music easily. Still learning all the features available\n",
      "Did t really know what I could use this device for. Used it for a few things, but need an overview\n",
      "Love this just wish it had a built in hub\n",
      "I use it primarily to play music.  It works wonderfully!  Still getting used to some of the many things it will do.  Amazon has sent several tips since I got it. Thanks for all your help!\n",
      "How easy if was to set up.\n",
      "Fast response which was amazing.  Clear concise answers and sound quality is fantastic.  I am still getting used to Alexia and have not usde Echo to its full extent.\n",
      "You’re all I need...na na nana!\n",
      "Does everything as expected and more.\n",
      "I love my Echo!  Works just like they said it would. I don't have a &#34;smart&#34; home, so I cannot speak about that function, but everything else about it is good.\n",
      "Great sound in a small package—easy to set up and use; fun to own.\n",
      "Works and sounds great.\n",
      "The sound is amazing and many collections of all music\n",
      "Setting up\n",
      "She doesn’t always listen\n",
      "It’s awesome\n",
      "I bought this because it can control fios television. It works well. I’m hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many “apps” you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I’m looking forward to implementing this controll. You can also add other Alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located.\n",
      "The speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly!\n",
      "I LIKE IT ALL\n",
      "I love it. It does everything\n",
      "I was a little nervous when I received my new Echo as I'm not really Tech savvy. I found it a bit intimidating at first but it didn't take me to long to figure it out!! I'm very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot!!!\n",
      "I like it and still learning how to use it.\n",
      "Great technology!! Can't believe the speaker volume and quality is so wonderful. Wish I had bought another one!\n",
      "I purchased an echo dot for my husband for Fathers Day.  He uses it constantly and after hearing the quality of sound of the Echo (2nd Generation), It was a no-brainer.  Best gift ever!\n",
      "Works fine!!\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Clear music\n",
      "Fun to use, good sound quality\n",
      "The echo works well. I was able to sync it with my other Amazon music devices.\n",
      "Works great, but I don't think Amazon should charge another cent for unlimited music when you 1) Have Prime AND 2) Buy an Echo.\n",
      "Already had an Echo Dot. The Echo is even better with fuller sound. Also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great!\n",
      "The speaker sounds really good\n",
      "Good sound works well\n",
      "Love it and Alexa. I am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient.\n",
      "Love it! I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It's fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I've been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music.\n",
      "We like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet.\n",
      "Love it - am using it strictly for music now and it's great!\n",
      "Love the Echo !!! I love the size, material and speaker quality. I have it hooked up to one light easily and will work on additional lights and thermostat. Next is Echo Dot for bedroom. There is a lot more to do with Echo that you think. Traffic, Weather, Trivia, etc.\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "The entire family loves Alexa Echo. She’s now a part of this family.\n",
      "Great fun getting to know all the functions of this product.  WOW -- family fun and homework help.  Talking with other grandchildren,who also have an Echo, is a HUGE bonus.  Can't wait to learn more and more and more\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "awesome thing, love Alexa\n",
      "It worked exactly as expected and the speaker has great sound. It is perfect for my classroom!\n",
      "LOVE, LOVE this new little gadget.  Has  made our lives so much easier.  it's like having our own personal secretary living here in the home.  We hardly need our CD's anymore, since ALEXA plays everything we need.  Going to get the Alexa DOTS soon for more rooms.  Thanks!!\n",
      "The speaker is of surprising quality. Happy with the purchase.\n",
      "Very easy to set up. Works wonderful and I love it!!\n",
      "I'm really impressed with the sound quality when playing music from this device.  The bass sounds almost like it's coming from a bigger speaker so props to Amazon.\n",
      "It’s still a great product.But the sound quality does seem worse.Don’t get me wrong. You definitely get used to it within an hour. But it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was better.Besides that , it’s great.With the addition of being able to play Just over Bluetooth with no WiFi, it’s even better.\n",
      "The outlet does not work with it. Was disappointed in that.\n",
      "Great device, responsive and helpful\n",
      "Sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose\n",
      "i liked the sound . what is troubling is that I paid extra money to have access to a million more songs. Sometimes it doesn't work. Ex. Alexa play Italian songs&#34; .don't have or don&#34; t understand. or play the opera Tosca, response &#34;sorry I don&#34;t have that.\n",
      "Easy to set up and use. Too bad it has to be plugged in. Would be nice to take it outside and operate on battery and recharged.\n",
      "Still learning all the ways to use it.  It is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it.  (5 and 7 yrs).  Very cute.\n",
      "4.5 out of 5 Stars. I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. Reason why I didn't rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my Echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. Seems to be a connection issue. Overall, great product.\n",
      "Works great, upgraded from echo dot to full size echo, couldn’t be happier!\n",
      "It's Alexa.... what else can you say\n",
      "Upgraded from my lilttle echo dot. Happy with sound\n",
      "Excellent product, set up with ease as well.\n",
      "I've had the first gen Echo since it first came out and it has worked well for me. I purchased the 2nd gen during Prime Day and so far I'm happy. It seems to have an improved speaker which provides enhanced sound for music and such.\n",
      "I love my Echo smart speaker.  I love the volume and clarity.  It was easy to set up.  ITs a wonderful gift for any age.\n",
      "wonderful product and fast delivery!\n",
      "Initially harder to set up called tech wasn’t that knowledgeable now working great.\n",
      "It was very easy to set up and my family love it’s!\n",
      "Has great sound and is very responsive my voice and commands.\n",
      "How did I live this long without the Echo . You get to enjoy any music style  just my asking Alexa . Going to up-greade to the wireless . Love the Echo . Love you too Alexa .\n",
      "Very cool product. Speaker sounds good with my Spotify blasting through it.\n",
      "Having so much fun with Alexa. Love being able to listen to music when I’m across the room or busy doing something else.\n",
      "So far it seems to be a very nice item. It picks up on my voice and understands me without any problems. The other day I asked it to turn down the music from the next room and it heard me just fine. I've only used it to listen to music and check the weather, but it has done both of those things very well.\n",
      "Love our echo\n",
      "I love it,she is very helpful. I use her for remembering things and sleep. You can ask her just about anything. I have only had her for about a week so still learning her.\n",
      "It's better than the 1st gen in every way except for one.  I really miss the ring at the top for volume control.  It was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &#34;-&#34; one and press it a few times.  I also wish the bass was a bit better.  All in all, it's a great device and I'm happy with it.\n",
      "I love having an Alexa!\n",
      "So far I like it 🤓\n",
      "I am thoroughly enjoying my Ecoo!  Love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then I can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere. Wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book. Great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more.\n",
      "Still love it\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "I love the sound quality of this unit, it is a very clear sound.\n",
      "I just this for listening to talk radio in the morning and turning lights on and off etc. The system does an excellent job as a full house sound system streaming Sirius.\n",
      "I have had for only a week, so I am still learning all that Alexa can do.  It is a learning process.  I love the music I can call up any time.  I listen to podcasts and radio stations.  I have just started keeping shopping lists and grocery lists, which I love.  I don’t have to search for paper and pencil.  Getting time and temperature are great, do not have to wait for weather reports.  The sound is good.  I am not fussy about woofers, tweeters, base , etc.  the Echo is fine for me.  This afternoon I am going to try “dropping in”.on my son when he gets home.  Going to surprise him.\n",
      "Not much features.\n",
      "Great sound quality, great features, great product. Multi room music is very cool.\n",
      "Cool\n",
      "Everyone should have an Echo or two or three or more. I bought my Echo through QVC.\n",
      "it's annoying that everything they show Alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. You spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself\n",
      "I have had Alexa since the beginning.  I accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation.  I decided I couldn't be without an Echo.  Setup was easy and had it working within minutes.\n",
      "I like being able to tell Alexia the music I want to hear, but sometimes she has trouble finding the song if I am not very specific about the title.\n",
      "I like the looks better than the original echo.  I moved my old echo to the basement family room. Nice sound.\n",
      "The Echo is wonderful but I'm still learning how to use it. Music requests are somewhat limited.\n",
      "Doesn't know half the things asked. Can't recognize my sprinkler wifi controller, even though product details says it is compatible. Can't program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same wifi router. Just a handy music player. That's if you have Amazon Music.\n",
      "Love it\n",
      "awesome.understands my kids\n",
      "We were pleasantly surprised at the sound quality and the many features. How nice to easily hear a particular artist or hear our books just by a simple command. Looking forward to exploring other options with this device.\n",
      "Met and exceeded my expectations. Easy set up and is really quick in responses.\n",
      "I like the fact that I can get any kind of music from Prime that I want on request from Alexa. I liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your TV etc. to the commands from Alexa. BUT, I really love having the music.\n",
      "i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account.  I think it should be part of the top line with video, music, etc.  I also think the setup app where i define, for example music i like, is not well integrated into echo.  I have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings.  I also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names, which i can never remember.I like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries.\n",
      "This is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better. Thank you!\n",
      "During Prime Day this 2nd gen Echo was on sale so I couldn't resist! This was the beginning to my smart home set up and I couldn't be happier to say that Alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my \"smart\" devices. Thanks to her, I can control my lights, smart plugs, TV, etc. I had no trouble connecting the Echo to my WiFi and my phone. The app works perfectly fine and it let's you add skills, routines, smart devices, timers, and so much more! Sound quality is good enough for me, since I am not an audiophile. Alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume. Design is great and modern, it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you'd like as there are more for sale. Overall, this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities. If you haven't yet, be sure to add Alexa to your home!\n",
      "Versatile and fun !!!\n",
      "Works great! Killer speaker! My wife and son love it.\n",
      "We regret waiting so long to purchase this item. We are both surprised and pleased with the sound quality.\n",
      "Stopped working after 2 weeks ,didn't follow commands!? Really fun when it was working?\n",
      "so far love it working on getting more things set up love the grocery list app\n",
      "It performs pretty much as expected, but I am very disappointed it will not provide me with the terminology I need to play various kinds of music without subscribing to the Amazon music service.  I understand my music choices may be limited, but without knowing HOW TO ASK, I cannot access the music that is provided free along with my Echo purchase.  Do you have a chart showing the language I need to use?\n",
      "Easy to set up.\n",
      "I like the product except that the speakers are not the high quality I expected\n",
      "A great investment. Alexa has helped me out and made me laugh.\n",
      "Yet another Exho for our home and love them all!!!\n",
      "I love it, I can plan any gender of music from big band to jazz, not easy to find on local radio. Sound is good and I can stop it with a voice command if I get a phone call.\n",
      "Good Value\n",
      "Super easy set up and am loving our new Echo!\n",
      "Whats not to like about this speaker.  Just ask Alexa\n",
      "BEST father's day gift. Dad joked to my mom that Alexa will be the one listening to all of his (repeated) stories going forward.\n",
      "Great addition to our breakfast room kitchen.  Tunes and information instantly available.  Slowly learning more features.\n",
      "Sound quality\n",
      "Sad joke. Worthless.\n",
      "Entertainment\n",
      "Very good quality\n",
      "Works great sounds great does not miss a beat wish it had a battery for better portability\n",
      "Loved it till someone stoled it. Can't afford to replace it yet but I am going too.\n",
      "Alexa rocks\n",
      "Got this as a gift and love it. I never would have bought one for myself, but now that I have it.... Allows me to play music on it from my amozon prime music ; that's worth it in and of itself.  Also, gives new's briefs and tells jokes.\n",
      "Good\n",
      "My mom bought a few Echo Dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great. I told her “no” for two days. When she made me take it, 6 hours later I could not live my life without it!  It’s that amazing, so now we have four large speakers and only the small Echo Dot, that I will be returning to her. I say if you’re going to order an Alexa speaker, go big and get the Echo, otherwise tou’ll Be returning the two Echo Dots you couldn’t live without.\n",
      "Love it!! Great product!!!\n",
      "Easy set up very user friendly\n",
      "Really disappointed Alexa has to be plug-in to wall socket all the time.  My fault for not checking this, but made the assumption that a company has technologically advanced as Amazon would sell this product with a rechargeable battery.  If I could return it, I would as my Apple music and boom speaker give me more flexibility the Alexa.\n",
      "I don't think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn't unique to this unit but I don't understand why I can't override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.\n",
      "Everything\n",
      "I like the interaction of asking questions. I don’t like that I can’t ask her to setup schedule of off and on of connected lamp.\n",
      "Supberb sound! Definitely worth the extra money if you listen to lots of music.\n",
      "I really love my amazon echo. I think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it. It is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports!\n",
      "Love it!  So do the grandkids!!\n",
      "So far it has worked well. Not always intuitive as to how to link different devices, or \"skills\", but getting the hang of it.\n",
      "Works as advertised\n",
      "I love it!\n",
      "Love my new addition to the house! Speaker quality is great and over all we love our Alexa. My only two ( not complaints, more suggestions for the future series) would be better communication ability. Example: For our smart lights in the house. Unless we specify kitchen Light 1 or kitchen Light 2 prior to the command she either won’t respond or says she doesn’t recognize. It may be me, but I want my Alexa to respond when I say thank you afterwards. I have to repeat Alexa thank you and there are times she won’t respond to me, but will my husband. I know it sounds odd. We laugh about it, but maybe it’s a Southern thing but I want my Alexa to have manners too.\n",
      "Like everything about it. The music, the trivia games, the weather.\n",
      "As described and received on time.  Do not like automatic enrolment into music.\n",
      "A great device\n",
      "I owned an echo for overa year but the new lacks the easy way to increase or decrease volume without telling it to increase or decrease volume which is hard to do for my wife since English is her second language she was born in korea. But the sound from the echo is superb. So we’ll keep it..\n",
      "Love this!  Have it in the kitchen and works well!\n",
      "Very nice!  I'm impressed - wish she had more to say though.\n",
      "Love the product. Nice to have easy access to so much info!!!\n",
      "It's got great sound and bass but it doesn't work all of the time. Its still hot or miss when it recognizes things\n",
      "We are still discovering all that the Echo can do.\n",
      "Amazing paroduct\n",
      "Good hearing range and sound quality. It was a bit complicated to set up and she doesn't quite understand me a lot even when I am speaking slowly and clearly but I love the flash briefing feature and interfacing with my abode home security system.\n",
      "speaker sounds good\n",
      "Absolutely love!!\n",
      "The best part of this product is you can control the thermostat and lights for your house.  There isn’t anything I dislike.\n",
      "We're thoroughly enjoying our Amazon Echo. Installation was easy using the Alexa app. I purchased 2 Kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights. Installation again was easy using the Kasa app. They sinqued right up with the Echo. We're enjoying playing music with the Echo and the sound quality is awesome. We've added a Kasa smart bulb for our kitchen. Setup was seamless. We're looking forward to adding more automation to our home.\n",
      "Home entertainment\n",
      "Very cool product. Easy to setup, fun to use and sound quality is much better than I anticipated.\n",
      "Love these,  great sound... easy to connect and use...\n",
      "Doesn't work with my fairly new smart TV, but that's mainly the TV manufacturers(LG) fault due to not supporting anything older than TVs from this year. My smart locks also need an additional piece of equipment in order to connect as well. Speakers sound great and works very well.\n",
      "Great sound from a little speaker\n",
      "We enjoy it\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Cool\n",
      "Good quality, great sound quality\n",
      "Works perfectly\n",
      "Great product. Sometimes Alexa does not understand some commands for my Fire TV. All in all, this is a fabulous speaker.\n",
      "Love my Echo great sound very smart!\n",
      "Sure did !! Love it !!\n",
      "plays great\n",
      "Works absolutely great\n",
      "Very amazing product. Great sound quality.\n",
      "Best thing I've invested in in a while thank you so much 😁😁😁😁\n",
      "I am extremely impressed with this item. Bought it from the &#34;warehouse&#34; or &#34;outlet&#34; with a &#34;minor imperfection. Can't tell it even has one. works great. Didn't come in packaging, but it was sealed up and had no damage and wasn't missing anything. I like the sound quality, I see some knock it. It's not a BOSE but it's more than great for our family. Easy to use, minor learning curve as it learns your voice. It integrates seamlessly with my other amazon services.Can't wait to get for my classroom too! It's a lot of fun even just as a speaker, let alone what I plan to do with it.\n",
      "I love my Echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it's wonderful!, music, info, sleeping sounds!\n",
      "Awesome life changer! Seriously, I am able to start my morning with Alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music. She has gotten used to my voice, that I can be in another room and she will &#34;listen&#34; to what I say. I love both my echos!!! Don't hesitate, get one and for the price, the speaker is unbelievable. I am buying the cordless holder, so I can take the echo anywhere. Love my purchase and love alexa!!!!\n",
      "I am not super impressed with Alexa. When my Prime lapsed, she wouldn't play anything. She isn't smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can't use it for that either. She randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her. Just today I unplugged her...not sure I'll ever use my Alexa again.\n",
      "I like everything about it !!!\n",
      "Liked 100%\n",
      "Never had ANY issue with buying use electronics as long as I get the GOOD or LIKE NEW. Just read the comment to see why it is used.\n",
      "Our family really loves this new Echo\n",
      "bought for my wife she loves it\n",
      "Fun just got it today now my I pod will go in my car and I will use this is the house.\n",
      "Like it to do more\n",
      "This is our third echo. Worth every penny. It's like having 3 household employees for a small flat rate. We keep them in the bedrooms and the living room. We can drop-in and use them as an intercom, listen to music, answer quick questions, alarms to wake up for school, etc.\n",
      "Listen music and set timer\n",
      "I received the echo in perfect condition. The device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues. Alexa is a great addition to our family!\n",
      "Good sound. Like it for music and scheduling. Like that i can get random thoughts recorded while I think about them. The jokes are cute!\n",
      "Purchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do.  So far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform.  Am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides.\n",
      "This echo is just as great as my others, even though it is smaller.\n",
      "Funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home!!!  Loving it!!\n",
      "I bought this to replace a &#34;Dot&#34; in my living room. Speaker is slightly better. It hears me better over the TV. Unfortunately, it doesn't understand or respond to my requests as well as the Dot. I frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what I want. The Dot usually does exactly what I want on the first request. I don't consider it an upgrade.\n",
      "I have had all good experience, so far with the second generation Echo. There are so many more things to learn, but I have not had the time yet. Right now, I am mostly enjoying the music, weather updates, using the alarm feature, and her personality. I have also purchased some mini smart socket yes. I am very excited to begin using them\n",
      "I’m having trouble connecting my tv to it, but I’m not exactly tech smart. I’m sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me. So far I’ve been using it mostly for music.\n",
      "Simply love my Echo. I hardly watch any TV at all anymore. I'm too busy listening to music. Speaker is pretty goo for its size. All the fun skills really make the echo fun for my whole family.\n",
      "Enjoyed entire echo experience\n",
      "Easy to set up.\n",
      "The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me.\n",
      "We are loving Ours very much\n",
      "I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best. I'm happy to see they are making improvements with each new one.It would be great to have updates to our little A.I.'s, I think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it. All in all I am very happy with her and I can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble. Thank you\n",
      "Very pleased with the Echo 2nd Generation. It is so nice to have Alexa available for music, weather, news, and probably a lot more we haven’t discovered.\n",
      "I am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the Echo. If you are a big fan of deep bass, this might not be sufficient for you though. The potential to control your home is an option I will explore more as I evolve my home into a \"smart home\". The voice recognition is very impressive. It is stylish and fun. I have no regrets with this purchase. It is great for technically changes people. Ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly. If you have an elderly loved one, this would be a great gift. Once connected to wifi, it is very simple to use.  If you want unlimited music control, be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj! You can even have conversations with the echo. I am not embarrassed to say, that echo has made me laugh a couple times when I ask it to tell me a joke. It tells me where my packages are since I am an amazon prime addict, it comes in extremely  handy!\n",
      "Easy to setup. Love all the things she does.\n",
      "Have Alexa throughout the house----the future has arrived!\n",
      "I already have an Alexa and with Amazon find today I could not resist getting an echo also. It is the best thing I ever did, I use them on each side of the house! And couldn't be happier!\n",
      "Arrived as expected.\n",
      "Bought this a few weeks ago -  everything about this product is excellent !!!!! Don't forget to buy a charger when ordering, it's a must have to take outside by the pool and not have to worry about hiring an electrician to put in outlets all over the yard.\n",
      "Terrific\n",
      "Love my Echo\n",
      "It’s smaller than the original. Looks nicer too.\n",
      "Works great!\n",
      "My husband and I are what I would call &#34;late adopters&#34; when it come to technology, but we decide we would try and Echo to serve primarily as a music source.  Wow, were we amazed and the great sound!  We've also been having a great time listening to all of our favorite songs buy just asking Alexa.  I may even buy one for my elderly Dad - I think he will enjoy having one to listen to music or even place his calls to us!\n",
      "I really have enjoyed it.  Changing the Directv channels, plays iHeartRadio and Pandora , adjusts the ac thermostat and turns the living room lights and outside lights.\n",
      "I have been wanting one of these for a while now.  Bought on Prime Day and absolutely love it.\n",
      "We are so glad that we got the Echo over a Bluetooth speaker. Alexa does so much more stuff than other non smart speakers out there. I personally love the timer feature. It has helped me with cooking multiple things simultaneously. Pandora integration is another feature that I use daily. So happy with out Prime Day purchase. I will get the Echo hub and a few more Echo dots in the future.\n",
      "See subject line.  Love it\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "Very easy setup.\n",
      "I was hesitant to buy the echo because I have the echo Dot and it seems good enough. The echo is the same except the sound quality, which I really didn't feel I needed. However, I am so glad I got it. What a difference! The sound really is far superior to the Echo Dot! Now I can listen to The Greatest Showman with a little more power!\n",
      "Sound quality is great. Still learning about all the different things I can do with it. FUN!!!\n",
      "Got a good deal and works great with Prime.  Setup was a bit of a pain but more the fault of crappy internet service.  Has worked great with nice sound from small speaker.\n",
      "I love it!!\n",
      "Works great! Perfect for my office!\n",
      "Love it--- have one inside house and one by our pool now . Just as good as Bose speakers around house -\n",
      "easy to use--amazing\n",
      "Nice product A+\n",
      "We love our Echo! We were totally amazed at the speaker quality. Only bummed we didn’t buy two since we got it on Prime day!\n",
      "Very responsive. Great sound quality for its size.\n",
      "It's so efficient and amazing!  How COOL!  We all use it often every day...\n",
      "I’m impressed with the quality of sound that the Echo has, it’s definitely comparable to my Bose Mini. I only gave 4 stars because I can’t use my Apple Music account.\n",
      "Technology in such a small device. The price was good too! The sound is amazing! A must have feature for any home!\n",
      "Mainly use it for the music but I’m learning more all the time.  Really nothing bad to say about it\n",
      "I replaced my 1st gen, was concerned about a smaller unit not having the same sound...I was wrong.  If anything it's the same volume, and more clear.  Good product.\n",
      "Great addition to my Echo Plus!\n",
      "the best\n",
      "Love the feature to play music in every room with multiple Echos.\n",
      "I love Alexa!  I am surprised how much I use her.\n",
      "I use this product for enjoyment and I just love it\n",
      "Easy to use and has great sound...It was a great purchase at a great price.\n",
      "Very easy to set up and have no issues.\n",
      "This unit add much pleasure to our Echo Plus.  We now can have music and information through our home. (or just in one room)\n",
      "It's extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesn't answer everything I ask but it's still nice to use.\n",
      "Too difficult to set up.  It keeps timing out before you can enter the password\n",
      "Just getting use to using the Echo. Used it for shopping lists, listening to music and as a timer. Working great so far.\n",
      "Very cool and lots of fun! Used for a week and still learning its capabilities.\n",
      "Love it, love it!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Love it but having a hard time setting up all the apps\n",
      "I use it in my office and another at my apartment for music and information\n"
